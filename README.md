Overview
================

CLAHub provides a low-friction way to have a Contributor License Agreement for
your open source project that's hosted on GitHub.  Contributors digitally sign
your CLA by signing in with GitHub.  Then, it automatically marks up your pull
requests based on whether the contributors have all signed your CLA.

Right now it's running at <http://www.clahub.com>

I don't intend for this to lead to a proliferation of CLAs.  But when they're
appropriate, I hope it can reduce the friction of contribution.

This project is a work-in-progress.  Any and all feedback is welcome!

It currently works, but could use UI and functionality improvement.  Find
such discussion in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/clahub/clahub/issues).

What's a CLA?
-------------
Contributor Agreements are a way to prove intellectual property (IP) provenance
of contributions to an open-source project.  They generally say that:

> 1. The code I’m contributing is mine, and I have the right to license it.

> 2. I’m granting you a license to distribute said code under the terms of this
> agreement (typically “as you see fit” or “under an OSI-approved license” or
> whatever).

Development
================

Prerequisites
----------------

Register a new app at GitHub to get an OAuth key and secret:

https://github.com/settings/applications/new

Set up a .env file with your GITHUB_KEY and GITHUB_SECRET.
You can also specify an HTTP port for local foreman:

    GITHUB_KEY=abc123
    GITHUB_SECRET=234897239872394832478
    PORT=3000

This file is .gitignored so it's private.

We use the `dotenv` gem to provide these variables to the test environment as
well.

JavaScript acceptance tests use
[poltergeist](https://github.com/jonleighton/poltergeist) which requires
installing [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org).  Follow the PhantomJS
installation instructions on the [poltergeist
README](https://github.com/jonleighton/poltergeist).

Getting set up
----------------

Install gems and initialize databases:

    bundle
    rake db:create db:migrate db:test:prepare

Run the tests to make sure things are working:

    rake

Running the app
----------------

Run with Foreman if you like:

    foreman start

Or as normal (.env is loaded by `dotenv` gem):

    rails server
    rails console

Coverage
----------------

Use SimpleCov to build code coverage:

    COVERAGE=true rake

LiveReload
----------------

When working on display-heavy features, [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/)
saves valuable keystrokes and time.  We use
[guard-livereload](https://github.com/guard/guard-livereload) to watch
templates and assets and reload when they change.

To take advantage of this:

* Install a [LiveReload browser extension](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-)
* Run `guard` on the command line.

Development and Webhooks
------------------------

As part of the app, we sign up to receive GitHub webhooks (HTTP requests to
`/repo_hook`) to be notified when stuff happens to repos we care about.  (In
particular, we want to know about new pushes so we can assess whether their
contributors have agreed to the relevant CLA.)

When you're developing locally, GitHub can't send webhook events
to you at `localhost:3000`, so use a local tunnelling service like
[ngrok](https://ngrok.com) or [localtunnel.me](https://localtunnel.me).

Then, you should run the Rails server with the `HOST` environment variable
set, like `HOST=http://my.fancy.dynamic.host.name rails server`, or set it in `.env`
if using `foreman`.  This is read in `config/initializers/host.rb`

*Note* that the dynamic hostname you use is saved in the GitHub webhook 
registrations.  If your dynamic hostname changes, you will need to update the
webhooks in GitHub so that it knows where to send the requests.
